# Base22-Interview
The main goals I had going into this project were 
1. Showcase my front-end skills 
2. Use technologies as close to listed as possible. This is mainly due to the fact, that while I feel confident in Vue.js I wanted to challenge myself to use technologies
  that would be potentially used in the workplace. 
  
 I started by creating the NPM project and included the dependencies and scripts I would need for this project. While this was my first time using Bootstrap I cannot believe
 it has taken me this long to use! Was incredibly easy to pick up and design the layout of the page to spec while keeping the responsiveness. 
 For my CSS I configured SASS to watch my SCSS file and convert any and all changes to a CSS file, which I then minified using a script through postcss-cli.
 
 For some of the going further requirements I realized how much I was missing out on by not using a full front-end framework. I used Handlebars for templating the 
 Testimonial of the month section, but was not able to figure out how I would implement the front-end rendering app. While I realize this would help greatly with 
 initial load times I tried to counteract that by using minified versions of everything I could (bootstrap, jquery, css).
 
 I had a lot of fun working through this project, the only regret I do have is not asking what framework you use or just asking what technologies could help me achieve the 
 front-end rendering portion.
